Here are three simple and engaging LinkedIn message templates for seeking referrals for an SDE profile:

For a Connection: "Hi [Name], I hope you're doing well! I’m actively looking for SDE opportunities and came across [Company Name]. I’d love to explore this further—do you have any advice or would you be open to referring me? Thanks a lot!"

For a Recruiter: "Hi [Name], I came across your profile while looking for opportunities at [Company Name]. I’m interested in applying for an SDE role and would love any guidance or referral you could offer. Thank you for your time!"

For a Mutual Connection or Alumni: "Hi [Name], I see we both have ties to [School/Mutual Connection]! I’m currently exploring SDE roles, and [Company Name] caught my attention. Could you help with a referral or advice on navigating the process? Thanks a ton!"

These are concise and to the point, encouraging engagement while respecting the recipient’s time.
